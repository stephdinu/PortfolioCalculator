# PortfolioCalculator
The following is an implementation of an algorithm that calculates the value of a portfolio for a given investor on a given reference date.

## How to build

1. Navigate to project root (for example, in your IDE of choice)
2. Place the required Investments.csv, Quotes.csv, and Transactions.csv files in the project root.
3. Run Main.main()
4. In the console, first enter the investor id (i.e. Investor42 or Investor96)
5. Next, enter a date in the console with the following format: YYYY-MM-DD
6. You should then receive a breakdown of the portfolio evaluation and the result of the calculated total portfolio worth.
